Audra Brown was born on the Texas-Arizona border, grew up in West-West-Texas, and is still living and working on the High Plains of New Mexico.

She writes about the realities and the humor of life in the agriculture business. There is never a shortage of adventure in farming, ranching, or just plain rural living. 

In her non-existent spare time, she also writes fiction, works as a computer wizard, keeps her hand in the cattle business, is a competitive 3-gun shooter, and enjoys the title of "World Champion of Destruction" from her achievements in the martial arts.
