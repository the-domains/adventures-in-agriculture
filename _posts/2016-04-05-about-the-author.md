She writes about the realities and the humor of life in the agriculture business. There is never a shortage of adventure in farming, ranching, or just plain rural living. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05a5f3cb-f490-43a9-bb3a-341deecdc865.jpg)

In her non-existent spare time, she also writes fiction, works as a computer wizard, keeps her hand in the cattle business, is a competitive 3-gun shooter, and enjoys the title of "World Champion of Destruction" from her achievements in the martial arts.
